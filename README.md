# Weather-App

## Description 

This app allows a user to search for a city's current weather as well as that city's 5 day forecast. Simply enter the city name into the search bar and your information will display. Search again and a new city's weather forecast will display, pushing your old search to a sidebar. Clicking a name in the sidebar allows you to look at your previous searches without having to type in the city name again.
